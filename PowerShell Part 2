Switch Statements: This allows you to compare a value against multiple conditions. Use a single variable that you want to compare against multiple values.

break: You would use 'break' when we match and you don't want to keep evaluating. 

In the editor:
$MartialArts = "Taekwondo"
Switch($MartialArts) {
    "Taekwondo" {Write-Host "Originated from Korea"; break}
    "Brazilian jiu-jitsu" {Write-Host "Originated from Brazil"; break}
    "Tai chi" {Write-Host "Originated from China"; break}
