PowerShell automation uses PowerShell scripts to automate tasks and processes on a Windows operating system. You can automate administrative tasks, manage system configurations, and perform various other tasks through the command-line interface.

Opened PowerShell ISE.

Create a scheduled task.

In the editor:
$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -At 4:21pm -Daily
$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute “powershell.exe” -Argument “-File ‘C:\\Scripts\\TestGoogle.ps1’”
$settings = New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet
Register-ScheduledTask -Action $action -Trigger $trigger -TaskName “Test Google” -Description “Tests connection with google.com” -Settings $settings

$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -At 3pm -Daily`: This line creates a new scheduled task trigger that will run the task at 3 PM daily.

$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute “powershell.exe” -Argument “-File ‘C:\\Scripts\\TestGoogle.ps1’”`: This line creates a new scheduled task action that specifies the execution of a PowerShell script located at "C:\Scripts\TestGoogle.ps1".

$settings = New-ScheduledSettingsSet: This line creates a new scheduled task settings set.

Register-ScheduleTask -Action $action -trigger -TaskName “Test Google” -Description “Tests connection with google.com” -Settings $settings`: This line registers the scheduled task with the specified action, trigger, task name ("Test Google"), description ("Tests connection with google.com"), and settings.

This scheduled task named "Test Google" will run a PowerShell script daily at 3PM to test the connection with google.com.
