Setting up Execution Policy to run scripts

To see your current Execution Policy.
In the terminal:
Get-ExecutionPolicy

My show 'Unrestricted' and it is a default execution policy for non-Windows computers and cannot be changed. Unsigned scripts can be run but, you have to make sure it's from a trusted source.
