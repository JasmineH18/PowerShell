OU's short from Organizational Units, are containers within an Active Directory domain that are used to organize and manage objects such as users, groups, computers, and other resources. OUs provide a way to structure and group objects based on administrative, geographical, or departmental criteria, allowing for easier management and delegation of administrative tasks within the domain. OUs can have Group Policy Objects (GPOs) linked to them to apply specific settings and configurations to the objects within the OU.

In the terminal:
New-ADOrganizationalUnit -Name "MCU" -Path "DC=marvel, DC=org"

In Active Directory, right clicked and clicked 'Refresh'. It'll show the OU I created, which is 'MCU'.
