Environments Used:
-Windows Server in VirtualBox
-Windows 10 VM in VirtualBox

First, I will create an Active Directory basic lab diagram. 

Hypervisor: VirtualBox
A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), allows you to create and run multiple virtual machines.The hypervisor abstracts the physical hardware resources of the host machine and allocates them to virtual machines, allowing each VM to operate independently as if it were running on its own dedicated hardware. I will be using VirtualBox as the hypervisor. VirtualBox is a Type 2 (hosted) Hypervisor that run on top of a conventional operating system. 

Virtual Machine: Windows 10
A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer that runs on a host machine. It allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine, enabling users to create isolated environments for running applications and services. Virtual machines are created using virtualization software, which partitions the host machine's resources (such as CPU, memory, storage, and network) and allocates them to the virtual machines. I will be using Windows 10 virtual machine and it'll be the client's machine.

Domain Controller: Windows Server 2022
A domain controller is a server that is running a version of the Windows Server operating system and has Active Directory Domain Services installed. The Windows version I'll be using is 2022.

I will Configure.
*Domain / Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
*Network Address Translation
*Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Server. Using 1 scope

Install the Domain Controller (Windows Server 2022)

Step 1: Downloaded the ISO from https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2022. Screenshot https://imgur.com/nUiVhML

Step 2: Registered for the free trial. Screenshot https://imgur.com/Fqakum1

Step 3: Selected the English ISO download 64-bit edition. Screenshot https://imgur.com/mKBFZ7U

Step 4: Add the Windows Server ISO to VirtualBox > Named it 'WindowsServer2022' > Adjusted settings. Screenshot https://imgur.com/yNWd6dj

Step 5: Started the 'WindowsServer2022' > Follow the prompts (Clicked 'Install Now'). Screenshot https://imgur.com/0UOCuAu

Step 6: For Operating Systems, selected 'Windows Server 2022 Standard Evaluation (Desktop Experience). Screenshot https://imgur.com/4Ss2Cya

Step 7: For installation type, selected 'Custom' > Selected the drive. Screenshot https://imgur.com/HnR1cla

Step 8: Add a password as a Administrator > login as Administrator > Server Manager will load. https://imgur.com/DgmuBui, https://imgur.com/myoL87J


Windows 10 VM
Already have Windows 10 VM in my Virtualox. Cloned the Windows 10 VM and named it 'Client 1 (Wins10)'


DHCP and NAT
Configured the DHCP/NAT in Windows Server.
