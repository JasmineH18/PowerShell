If... then... else conditionals: If/then/else statements run code blocks if a specified conditional test evaluates to true or false.

If statement
In the editor:
$Fishcaught = "30"
If ($Fishcaught -eq 30) {Write-Host "You've won a prize!"}

Output:
You've won a prize!

If conditions not met.

In the editor:
$Fishcaught = "29"
If ($Fishcaught -eq 30) {
        Write-Host "You've won a prize!"
    } Else {
        Write-Host "You get no prize."
    }

Output: 
You get no prize.

If conditions are met.

In the editor:

If ($Fishcaught -eq 30) {
        Write-Host "You've won a prize!"
    } Else {
        Write-Host "You get no prize."
    }

Output: 
You've won a prize!

Elseif conditionals: Elseif is used to specify an alternative condition to be evaluated if the initial "If" condition is false.

-ge is short for greater than or equal to
-le is short for less than or equal to

In the editor:
$TemperatureNum = 95
If($TemperatureNum -ge 1 -and $TemperatureNum -le 80) {
    Write-Host "The temperature is good."
} Elseif ($TemperatureNum -ge 81 -and $TemperatureNum -le 90) {
    Write-Host "The temperature is hot!"
} Elseif ($TemperatureNum -ge 91 -and $TemperatureNum -le 100) {
    Write-Host "The temperature is too hot to go outside!"
}

Output:
The temperature is too hot to go outside!

Switch Statements: This allows you to compare a value against multiple conditions. Use a single variable that you want to compare against multiple values.

break: You would use 'break' when we match and you don't want to keep evaluating. 

In the editor:
$MartialArts = "Taekwondo"
Switch($MartialArts) {
    "Taekwondo" {Write-Host "Originated from Korea"; break}
    "Brazilian jiu-jitsu" {Write-Host "Originated from Brazil"; break}
    "Tai chi" {Write-Host "Originated from China"; break}
}

Output:
Originated from Korea

For Loops: For Loops are used in PowerShell scripting to iterate over a set of items or perform a specific action a certain number of times.

Example 1
For each iteration of this loop. For loop have three parameters. I have four elements: IT, Smile, The Nun, and Megan. Our counter starts from 0 (IT is the 0). The condition counter will be less than equal to 3 (Smile, The Nun, and Megan is 1,2,3). Stop the loop using $counter++. '++' is taking the value of counter and adding 1 to itself.    

Our counter: $counter =0
Our Condition: $counter -le 3
Stop the loop: $counter++
To loop through our counter: $HorrorMovies[$counter]

In the editor:
$HorrorMovies = @('IT', 'Smile', 'The Nun', 'Megan')
For ($counter =0; $counter -le 3;$counter++){
     Write-Host "I can not wait to watch" $HorrorMovies[$counter]
}

Output:
I can not wait to watch IT
I can not wait to watch Smile
I can not wait to watch The Nun
I can not wait to watch Megan

Screenshot: https://imgur.com/kcpYFGR

Example 2
If you change the $counter -le 3 to $counter -le 6. It will notice no extra elements are found, and it'll be blank.

In the editor:
$HorrorMovies = @('IT', 'Smile', 'The Nun', 'Megan')
For ($counter =0; $counter -le 4;$counter++){
     Write-Host "I can not wait to watch" $HorrorMovies[$counter]
}

Output:
I can not wait to watch IT
I can not wait to watch Smile
I can not wait to watch The Nun
I can not wait to watch Megan
I can not wait to watch
I can not wait to watch
I can not wait to watch

Check the length value of the variable $HorrorMovies.

In the console: 
$HorrorMovie.Length

Output:
4

Foreach Loops: Foreach Loops iterate over a collection of items, such as an array or a list, and perform a specific action on each item in the collection.

In the editor:
$HorrorMovies = @('IT', 'Smile', 'The Nun', 'Megan')
Foreach ($Movies in $HorrorMovies){
    Write-Host $Movies "is scary!"
}

Output:
IT is scary!
Smile is scary!
The Nun is scary!
Megan is scary!

While Loops: While Loop evaluates a condition before each iteration of the loop, and if the condition is true, the code block is executed.

Start the counter to 0 (Batman is 0): $counter = 0
While counter not equal to 6: $counter -ne
Display the strings: Write-Host $DC[$counter]
Stop the loop: $counter++

In the editor:
$DC = @('Batman', 'Catwoman', 'Penguin', 'Poison Ivy', 'The Riddler', 'The Mad Hatter')
$counter = 0 
While($counter -ne 6){
    Write-Host $DC[$counter]
    $counter++;
}

Output:
Batman
Catwoman
Penguin
Poison Ivy
The Riddler
The Mad Hatter

You can also echo the variable array back and/or show the element length.

In the editor:
$DC = @('Batman', 'Catwoman', 'Penguin', 'Poison Ivy', 'The Riddler', 'The Mad Hatter')
$counter = 0 
While($counter -ne 6){
    Write-Host $DC[$counter] "is part of DC!"
    $DC[$counter].Length
    $counter++;
}

Output:
Batman is part of DC!
6
Catwoman is part of DC!
8
Penguin is part of DC!
7
Poison Ivy is part of DC!
10
The Riddler is part of DC!
11
The Mad Hatter is part of DC!
14

Screenshot: https://imgur.com/VfdsrT8

Infinite While loop: You can set it to equal to some condition that will never be met if you remove the $counter++.

Removed ($counter++;) and changed the (-ne 6) to -ne -1

In the editor:
$DC = @('Batman', 'Catwoman', 'Penguin', 'Poison Ivy', 'The Riddler', 'The Mad Hatter')
$counter = 0 
While($counter -ne -1){
    Write-Host $DC[$counter] "is part of DC!"
    $DC[$counter].Length
}

Output: It'll repeat it until you press CTRL + C
Batman is part of DC!
6
Batman is part of DC!
6

Do While Loops: The condition is evaluated after the script has run.

In the editor:
$DC = @('Batman', 'Catwoman', 'Penguin', 'Poison Ivy', 'The Riddler', 'The Mad Hatter')
$counter = 0
Do {
   Write-Host $DC[$counter] "is part of DC!" 
   $counter++
} While ($counter -ne 6)

Output:
Batman is part of DC!
Catwoman is part of DC!
Penguin is part of DC!
Poison Ivy is part of DC!
The Riddler is part of DC!
The Mad Hatter is part of DC!
